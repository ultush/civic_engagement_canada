<p>This project is an investigation into different aspects of civic engagement in Canada.</p>

<p>The <strong>short term purpose</strong> is to determine linkages between voter turnout and social sector organization density.</p>

<p>The <strong>medium term purpose</strong> is to determine the linkages between different aspects of civic engagement.</p>

<p>The <strong>long-term purpose</strong> to determine pathways for increasing civic engagement. </p>

<p><strong>Scope</strong>: The current scope is the Greater Toronto Area, which provides some useful comparisons within the city of Toronto as well as comparisons with surrounding cities</p>

<p>The analysis can be replicated fr other metropolitan areas in Canada for broader comparisons</p>

<p>The <strong>roadmap and plan</strong> as it evolves:</p>

<p>Two forms of civic engagement are of initial interest, Voter Turnout and Social Economy Organizations.  These two aspects of civic engagement are highly related, see References and Further Readings.</p>

<h2>
<a id="1-voter-turnout" class="anchor" href="#1-voter-turnout" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>1) Voter Turnout</h2>

<p>1.1) Federal</p>

<p>1.2) Provincial</p>

<p>1.3) Municipal</p>

<h2>
<a id="2-social-economy-organizations" class="anchor" href="#2-social-economy-organizations" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>2) Social Economy Organizations</h2>

<p>2.1) Charities</p>

<p>2.2) Nonprofits</p>

<p>2.3) Cooperatives</p>

<p>2.4) Unincorporated grassroots organizations</p>

<p><strong>Analysis</strong>: The analysis would include Correlations and Regression testing between for example: Municipal Voter Turnout and Nonprofit Organization Density by Postal Code</p>

<p>Step 1: Identify Data Sources</p>

<p>Step 2: Cleanup Data</p>

<p>Step 3: Convert/Transform data if required </p>

<p>Step 4: Test hypotheses </p>

<p>Step 5: Map/Visualize Data ?</p>

<p>Step 6: Update Hypotheses and retest</p>

<p>Step 7: Writeup conclusions</p>

<a id="references-and-further-reading" class="anchor" href="#references-and-further-reading" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>References and Further Reading</h2>

<p>The main study of interest that could be replicated in Canada:</p>

<ol>
<li>Kim, M. (2013). Socioeconomic Diversity, Political Engagement, and the Density of Nonprofit Organizations in US Counties. The American Review of Public Administration, 45(4), 402-416</li>
</ol>

<p>Main points:</p>

<p>Higher Political Engagement (voter turnout in Presidential election) = Higher density of nonprofits in a US county</p>

<p>Higher Income Inequality (Gini Coefficient) = Higher density of nonprofits in a US county</p>

<p>Higher Ethno-Racial Diversity = Lower density of nonprofits in a US county</p>

<p>With ethno-racial diversity increasing in Canadian cities, the last conclusion is a cause for concern.
With income inequality increasing in Canada, the second conclusion is positive for the nonprofit sector, but not necessarily positive for everyone.</p>

<p>Additional layers of data for analysis could include: </p>

<p>The Canadian Well Being Index (which includes measures on Democratic Engagement)</p>

<p>Need to be one of the member organizations</p>

<p>Environmental aspects such as density of Community Gardens and how they relate to Civic Engagement?</p>
