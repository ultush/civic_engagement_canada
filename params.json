{"name":"Civic Engagement Canada","tagline":"Exploring the Linkages between Vooter Turnout and density of Charities, Nonprofits, Cooperatives and the Social Economy to increase Civic Engagement ","body":"# Civic_Engagement_Canada wiki! #\r\n\r\nThis project is an investigation into different aspects of civic engagement in Canada.\r\n\r\nThe **short term purpose** is to determine linkages between voter turnout and social sector organization density.\r\n \r\nThe **medium term purpose** is to determine the linkages between different aspects of civic engagement.\r\n\r\nThe **long-term purpose** to determine pathways for increasing civic engagement. \r\n\r\n**Scope**: The current scope is the Greater Toronto Area, which provides some useful comparisons within the city of Toronto as well as comparisons with surrounding cities\r\n\r\nThe analysis can be replicated fr other metropolitan areas in Canada for broader comparisons\r\n\r\n\r\nThe **roadmap and plan** as it evolves:\r\n\r\nTwo forms of civic engagement are of initial interest, Voter Turnout and Social Economy Organizations.  These two aspects of civic engagement are highly related, see References and Further Readings.\r\n\r\n## 1) Voter Turnout\r\n\r\n1.1) Federal\r\n\r\n1.2) Provincial\r\n\r\n1.3) Municipal\r\n\r\n## 2) Social Economy Organizations\r\n\r\n2.1) Charities\r\n\r\n2.2) Nonprofits\r\n\r\n2.3) Cooperatives\r\n\r\n2.4) Unincorporated grassroots organizations\r\n\r\n**Analysis**: The analysis would include Correlations and Regression testing between for example: Municipal Voter Turnout and Nonprofit Organization Density by Postal Code\r\n\r\nStep 1: Identify Data Sources\r\n\r\nStep 2: Cleanup Data\r\n\r\nStep 3: Convert/Transform data if required \r\n\r\nStep 4: Test hypotheses \r\n\r\nStep 5: Map/Visualize Data ?\r\n\r\nStep 6: Update Hypotheses and retest\r\n\r\nStep 7: Writeup conclusions\r\n\r\n\r\n##References and Further Reading\r\n\r\nThe main study of interest that could be replicated in Canada:\r\n\r\n1. Kim, M. (2013). Socioeconomic Diversity, Political Engagement, and the Density of Nonprofit Organizations in US Counties. The American Review of Public Administration, 45(4), 402-416\r\n\r\nMain points:\r\n\r\nHigher Political Engagement (voter turnout in Presidential election) = Higher density of nonprofits in a US county\r\n\r\nHigher Income Inequality (Gini Coefficient) = Higher density of nonprofits in a US county\r\n\r\nHigher Ethno-Racial Diversity = Lower density of nonprofits in a US county\r\n\r\nWith ethno-racial diversity increasing in Canadian cities, the last conclusion is a cause for concern.\r\nWith income inequality increasing in Canada, the second conclusion is positive for the nonprofit sector, but not necessarily positive for everyone.\r\n\r\n###Further reading:\r\n\r\nMeinhard, A., Faridi, F., O’Connor, P., & Randhawa, M.
